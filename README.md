<h1> Current Projects </h1>

- I am not working on any projects at the moment, however I do have some plans to create a lightweight,
  modern looking browser sometime in the future, which should be a fun project to work on.
  
<h1> Planned Future Projects </h1>

- An Ubuntu/Debian Based OS named InfinityOS, I have already tried but I never found the time or motivation for it.
- A Lightweight browser, similar to Pale Moon, but more modern feeling.
